            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This website is a project from Codecademy to practice creating a website that 
                utilises various different parts of HTML, CSS and Javascript languages,
                whilst also using Github repositories to version control the website.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="reason">
            <h2>Reason</h2>
            <p>Whilst learning through Codecademy active lessons are great for learning, 
                creating websites from scartch and ensuring everything works together is 
                crucial to being successful.

        <section class="goal">
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>My goal for this website is to utilise the different coding languages for 
                website development and reinforce the lessons learnt through Codecademy.<br>
                <br>This website should use HTML to fill each page with information, 
                CSS to style each page in a consistent way, Javascript to show some inteartcivity 
                with the browser and Github for version control as a form of redundency.
