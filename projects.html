                Fullstack Developer coarse to practice the various diffferent coding languages.

                <h3>Website Style Guide</h3>
                <p>This project is a basic style guide for a website that can be used to 
                    keep the formatting in CSS consistent through multiple webpages.</p>

                <h3>Flexbox Site</h3>
                <p>This project used flexbox to show examples of how to use flexbox in CSS.
                    During this process, I also played around with grids and @media to make 
                    the webpage uniform and accessible to different devices.</p>

                <h3>Desmoto's Art & Crafts</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this static webpage is to play around and learn with CSS.
                    Using provided images and a sample webpage, I created a replica of the 
                    existing sample site through using browser dev tools and my own 
                    knowledge of HTML and CSS.

                <h3>Tea Cozy</h3>
                <p>The Tea Cozy webpage is a static page created off an example layout 
                    diagram provided on Codecademy. This page practices the various CSS styling 
                    that had been taught, whilst also showing how a website might be created 
                    from a layout diagram to meet a certain criteria.

                <h3>Password Generator</h3>
                <p>This password generator was created purely with Javascript. The example prompt 
                    given by Codecademy was to create a message generator that created three 
                    seperate statements with random words filling blanks each time. I personally 
                    wasn't interested in creating messages, so I created a code block that takes 
                    a number input for the length of a passcode and generates a random sequence 
                    of letters (both capital and lower case), numbers and punctuation of the chosen length.
